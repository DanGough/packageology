Hi, and welcome to my new blog!

My name is Dan Gough and I am a consultant specialising in application compatibility, packaging and virtualization. I will be blogging about my real-world experiences wrestling with these technologies, sharing tips, exposing bugs and workarounds, and commenting on the latest news in the industry.
