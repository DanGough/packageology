I have been a regular attendee to the European App-V User Group ([appvug.com](http://appvug.com)) for the last few years and have found it a great place to learn and share information about App-V, meet various bloggers and MVPs and network with fellow professionals - as well as being a fun day out of course!

It appears that there is plenty of demand over here in the UK for a similar event, so it is with great pleasure that I, along with Danny Clarke, Nathan Sperry, Thamim Karim and Nicke Källén present the first App-V User Group UK, sponsored by [add3](http://www.add3.co.uk/).

It will be held on Friday 3rd October at Microsoft's London office at Cardinal Place. We are still finalising the agenda, so watch this space for further details. Expect a star studded roster of App-V bloggers and MVPs to be presenting!

In the meantime, get over to [appvuguk.eventbrite.com](https://appvuguk.eventbrite.com) and register as soon as you can, as availability is limited.
