Check out this handy new PowerShell Module from [Andreas Nick](https://twitter.com/NickInformation):

There are plenty of uses for this such as:

* Extracting icons from App-V packages (useful when publishing via SCCM)
* List all packages that contain WinSxs components (i.e. VCRedists)
* List all packages that contain scripts

Andreas also has a tool to generate package reports directly from the App-V Server:

He is also working on some client tools to bring functionality such as launching an app by double-clicking on an App-V file (which should allow self-service of apps by standard users), and a GUI app that runs in the tray for managing applications!
