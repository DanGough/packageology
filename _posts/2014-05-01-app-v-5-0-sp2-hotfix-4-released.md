If you're using App-V 5, you *need* this update!

With this, users can have full write permissions to the VFS, and can also start applications on network shares without having to give the computer account access to the share. Package branching is back too, so you can save a package with a new package ID, which is handy for testing changes without affecting the live package. There's plenty more good stuff in this update, check out Tim Mangan's article for more info:

I've still yet to test this, but here is the new permissions checkbox in all it's glory. I recommend enabling this by default and saving it to a template:
