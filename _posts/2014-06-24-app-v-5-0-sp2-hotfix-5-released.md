This update was actually released a few weeks ago but it's not widely known about so I am spreading the word!

[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2963211/en-gb](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2963211/en-gb)

This release has the following changes:

* Connection groups can now support a mixture of per-user and globally published packages
* Powershell cmdlets now support -UserSID parameter for running commands as another user from an administrator session
* PackageStoreAccessControl (PSAC) has been deprecated

Also, this will contain all the changes from [Hotfix 4]({% post_url 2014-05-01-app-v-5-0-sp2-hotfix-4-released %} "App-V 5.0 SP2 Hotfix 4 Released!"), which if you haven't installed yet, you really should!
