Four App-V MVPs, Nicke Källén, Kalle Saunamäki, Ment van der Plas and Falko Gräfe have come together to write a book about App-V 5, and they are releasing each chapter at a time as they are written for free for a limited time.

Each chapter will only be available until the following one is released, and once complete you will only be able to buy the complete book, so get in quick!

To sign up you just have to email [info@appvbook.com](mailto:info@appvbook.com) to ask for it and they will email you a download link each time a new chapter comes out.

The first chapter is just about Windows apps in general and contains lots of info relevant for packaging and sequencing on App-V 4.6 (such as how file extensions and COM work, etc), so it's well worth a read.
